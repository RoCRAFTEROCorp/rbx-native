//! Auto-Recovery: a copy of the open place, written in the background every
//! few minutes while it has changes Ctrl+S has not written, so a crash or a
//! killed process loses minutes of work rather than everything since the
//! last save. Real Studio's own Auto-Recovery (Studio Settings › Studio ›
//! Auto-Recovery) is the model; the shell side lives in `shell::recovery`.
//!
//! One copy per place, overwritten each time, in `<config>/recovery`. A
//! manual save deletes it: what it held is now in the place itself. A copy
//! an earlier session left behind (it crashed, or was killed) is never
//! overwritten or deleted: opening its place moves it aside under a
//! timestamped name (see [`kept_path`]). A copy a running editor owns is
//! never touched by another: each session holds an OS lock beside its copy,
//! and a second editor on the same place writes its own (see [`claim`]).
//! Unlike
//! Studio's, a recovered copy loses nothing that tied it to its place — a
//! place here is a local file, and the copy is the same kind of file.
