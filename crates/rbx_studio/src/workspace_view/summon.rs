//! Studio's handle summoning, and the free-drag ball at the gizmo's origin.
//!
//! Roblox's own announcement ("Pivot Points - Studio Beta Update: Handle
//! Summoning", DevForum topic 1335668, carried into "Pivot Editor: Full
//! Release", topic 1403027): "simply **hold the tab key**, and the handles
//! of the tool you have selected will be **summoned** directly to the
//! location of your cursor … When you're done, you *release* the tab key,
//! and the handles will return to their normal location." Read off it:
//!
//! - Move's, Scale's and Rotate's handles all summon (Transform's too, being
//!   the three at once).
//! - "When summoning the rotate handles, the selection will be rotated
//!   around the point that you summoned them to" — Rotate's rings turn the
//!   selection about wherever they stand, so that comes for free.
//! - "if you place your cursor close to an edge or vertex when summoning,
//!   the handles will snap to that edge or vertex" — said of Rotate, and
//!   kept to the tools with Rotate's rings here; see [`onto_edges`].
//! - Scale's balls are kept "within the bounds of [the] selected object" —
//!   see `rbx_viewer::gizmo::Faces::summoned` for how that is read here.
//!
//! The announcement does not say whether the handles follow the cursor
//! while `Tab` stays down. They are placed once, at the press: handles that
//! kept chasing the cursor could never be reached by it.
//!
//! The free-drag ball (`rbx_viewer::gizmo::Handles::grab_origin`) is this
//! editor's own addition, not Studio's: it is Move's body drag held from the
//! gizmo's origin, which is what still lets a summoned Move gizmo carry the
//! selection freely when the part itself is nowhere near the cursor.
