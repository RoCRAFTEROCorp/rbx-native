//! The viewport's transform toolbar: which of Studio's tools is active,
//! whether its handles follow the world's axes or the part's own, and the
//! keystrokes that change either.
//!
//! The state lives in [`crate::shell::Shell`] — the toolbar renders from it —
//! and is pushed down to [`crate::workspace_view::WorkspaceView`], which
//! hit-tests the cursor against the handles, and on to the render thread,
//! which draws them.
//!
//! Shortcuts and behaviour follow `creator-docs`
//! (`parts/index.md#transform-parts`): `2` for Move, `3` for Scale, `4` for
//! Rotate, `Ctrl`/`Cmd`+`L` for local orientation. `5` for Transform is this
//! editor's own extension of that sequence: `creator-docs` documents no
//! shortcut for it (see [`Tool::Transform`]), so continuing the run of
//! digits the other three already use is this editor's own choice, not a
//! confirmed one.
