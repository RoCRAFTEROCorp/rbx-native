//! own `ChildData2` (`ChildData` in older files) where it carries them, as
//! every union Studio writes today does, or else from the
//! `PartOperationAsset` its legacy `AssetId` names. Roblox's own baked
//! `MeshData`/`MeshData2` is read only where neither holds a tree (`baked`).
//!
//! Two-phase like `filemesh`: [`plan`] walks the DOM for every operation, and
//! [`resolve`] joins that plan against downloaded asset bytes once they exist
//! (an inline tree is its own bytes). No network access happens here — see
