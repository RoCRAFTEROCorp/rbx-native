//! Walks the operation tree inside a legacy union's downloaded asset.
//!
//! `PartOperationAsset.ChildData` is itself a nested `.rbxm`; every
//! `UnionOperation`/`NegateOperation` found while walking it stores ITS OWN
//! children the same way, one freshly-deserialized document per level, down
//! to the original `BasePart`s a builder combined before Studio baked the CSG
//! result. `MeshData` (the baked triangle mesh) is not read here: the
//! geometry `super::csg` rebuilds from the tree supersedes it, and
//! `super::baked` reads it only for a union whose tree is gone or will not
//! carve.
//!
//! Empirically (see the `#[ignore]`d download test), a node's own `CFrame`
//! property is not useful on its own when its parent is a `NegateOperation`:
//! it always carries a zero position with the *operation's own* rotation, a
//! redundant echo of the parent rather than a further local offset — `walk`'s
//! `echo` parameter skips composing it in that case. Everywhere else, placing
//! every part is standard CFrame-parenting composition of each operation
//! node's `CFrame` down from the union's own frame — every [`Leaf::cframe`]
//! is that composed result, in the union's local space so one tree serves
//! every instance.
