//! Instances as plain triangle meshes, written out as Wavefront `.obj` or
//! glTF 2.0 for another 3D tool to open.
//!
//! Every part is exported as the geometry the viewport draws it with — the
//! same `scene::shape::resolve` precedence and unit meshes for the procedural
//! solids, the same fitted `MeshId` triangles for a `MeshPart` or a
//! `SpecialMesh` FileMesh (see [`crate::pick`], which resolves a click the same
//! way) — baked into world space. A `UnionOperation` exports the boolean
//! `scene::union` carved from its original parts (never Roblox's own baked
//! `MeshData`); where that boolean could not be run, the additive pieces the
//! viewport draws instead. A file mesh that has not downloaded exports as
//! the box it is drawn as.
//!
//! Each part is shaded as the viewport shades it (see [`part`]): its image or
//! `SurfaceAppearance`, its `Material`'s pack, tiled where one projection
//! covers a face and baked (see [`bake`]) where the shader blends three or
//! multiplies the pack under a mesh's image, and the materials no texture
//! captures (Neon, Glass, ForceField) as a [`Finish`] the writers turn into
//! what each format has closest. Images are pooled in [`Export::textures`]:
//! one the whole place shares is encoded and written once.
//!
//! The instance tree comes along as [`Export::nodes`], one per part and one
//! per container between it and the exported root, the way Studio's own
//! glTF export keeps the hierarchy. Units are studs, unscaled, in Roblox's
//! own right-handed Y-up frame, which is also glTF's and what Studio's
//! exporter writes.
